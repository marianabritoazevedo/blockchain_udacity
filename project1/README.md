# 🔲🔗 Create Your Own Private Blockchain

This project aims to create a private blockchain to get familiarized with these concepts: block, blockchain, wallet, blockchain identity and proof of existence. In this project, it was gave a boilerplate code with a REST Api already setup to expose some of the functionalities, and the goal is to implement them in a private blockchain.

## ❓ The problem

Your employer is trying to make a test of concept on how a Blockchain application can be implemented in his company.
He is an astronomy fans and he spend most of his free time on searching stars in the sky, that's why he would like
to create a test application that will allows him to register stars, and also some others of his friends can register stars
too but making sure the application know who owned each star.

### Process to be implemented in the application

1. The application will create a Genesis Block when we run the application.
2. The user will request the application to send a message to be signed using a Wallet and in this way verify the ownership over the wallet address. The message format will be: `<WALLET_ADRESS>:${new Date().getTime().toString().slice(0,-3)}:starRegistry`;
3. Once the user have the message the user can use a Wallet to sign the message.
4. The user will try to submit the Star object for that it will submit: `wallet address`, `message`, `signature` and the `star` object with the star information.
    The Start information will be formed in this format:
    ```json
        "star": {
            "dec": "68° 52' 56.9",
            "ra": "16h 29m 1.0s",
            "story": "Testing the story 4"
		}
    ```
5. The application will verify if the time elapsed from the request ownership (the time is contained in the message) and the time when you submit the star is less than 5 minutes.
6. If everything is okay the star information will be stored in the block and added to the `chain`
7. The application will allow us to retrieve the Star objects belong to an owner (wallet address). 

### Tools and technologies used

- This application will be created using Node.js and Javascript programming language. The architecture will use ES6 classes
because it will help us to organize the code and facilitate the maintnance of the code.
- The company suggest to use Visual Studio Code as an IDE to write your code because it will help you debug the code easily
but you can choose the code editor you feel confortable with.
- Some of the libraries or npm modules you will use are:
    - "bitcoinjs-lib": "^4.0.3",
    - "bitcoinjs-message": "^2.0.0",
    - "body-parser": "^1.18.3",
    - "crypto-js": "^3.1.9-1",
    - "express": "^4.16.4",
    - "hex2ascii": "0.0.3",
    - "morgan": "^1.9.1"
    Remember if you need install any other library you will use `npm install <npm_module_name>`

Libraries purpose:

1. `bitcoinjs-lib` and `bitcoinjs-message`. Those libraries will help us to verify the wallet address ownership, we are going to use it to verify the signature.
2. `express` The REST Api created for the purpose of this project it is being created using Express.js framework.
3. `body-parser` this library will be used as middleware module for Express and will help us to read the json data submitted in a POST request.
4. `crypto-js` This module contain some of the most important cryotographic methods and will help us to create the block hash.
5. `hex2ascii` This library will help us to **decode** the data saved in the body of a Block.

### Understanding the boilerplate code

The Boilerplate code is a simple architecture for a Blockchain application, it includes a REST APIs application to expose the your Blockchain application methods to your client applications or users.

1. `app.js` file. It contains the configuration and initialization of the REST Api, the team who provide this boilerplate code suggest do not change this code because it is already tested and works as expected.
2. `BlockchainController.js` file. It contains the routes of the REST Api. Those are the methods that expose the urls you will need to call when make a request to the application.
3. `src` folder. In here we are going to have the main two classes we needed to create our Blockchain application, we are going to create a `block.js` file and a `blockchain.js` file that will contain the `Block` and `BlockChain` classes.

## 💡 The solution

### How to run this project

1- Clone this repository, and then, go to the folder `project1` to find the files related to this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/marianabritoazevedo/blockchain_udacity.git
cd project1
```

2- Run the command below to install the requirements:
```
npm install
```
OBS.: to run this project on Windows, it was added to `package.json` the library `tiny-secp256k1`.

3- Run the application:
```
node app.js
```

4- Using Postman Agent or Insomnia, use the server URL (localhost:8000) to test the API endpoints of this application.
